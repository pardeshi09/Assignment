In any programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. We have many different types of expressions in Python.\n",

The operators used in these expressions are arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction, etc. Here are some arithmetic operators in Python:\n",
